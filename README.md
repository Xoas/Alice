## What's Harmony and the Harmony Open Source Collaboration Project?

Harmony is a music player that lets you connect to social networks and fetch your music so you can enjoy it "better", created by Vincent Loewert.

...but currently (by decision of the creator to "get something in return") is nagware and proprietary software.

The Harmony Open Source Collaboration Project is the project that keeps alive the best of the original application without any interest, from the community, for you, with love.

This project is intended to be an open and improved project, optimized and trying to work in a decentralized way, if the APIs of the original application still allow us to use it legally.

## Contribute/Todos

If you found a bug, please post the bug [on this page](https://github.com/xoascf/harmony/issues) and include if you can console's output and steps to reproduce the problem in your bug report.

You can access the log under the console tab of the devtools (Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+i).

If you want to develop, you can look at the issues, especially the bugs and then try to fix them.

Or if you enjoyed using Harmony and would like to support the development, please consider buying the application [here](https://getharmony.xyz/buy). This will not support me in anything, but at least it will feed the original creator of the app.

Translations are not yet a high priority, but you can support us with that, well... it is expected that the system will be implemented in the future, please be patient.

Wait for the v0.8.0 update!

## Development environment

To get a local development copy running, you will need:

- [npm][], usually installed with [node][]
- [git][], version control tool

[git]: http://git-scm.com/
[npm]: http://npmjs.org/
[node]: http://nodejs.org/

Follow the steps below to get a development copy set up:

```bash
# Clone our repository
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/xoascf/harmony.git
cd harmony/

# Install our dependencies and dev dependencies
npm install

# Start up
npm start
```

After running the above steps, a copy of Harmony should begin running.


## License

This repo is a product of the license established in the license page of the app [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20171115010739/https://getharmony.xyz/license), because it does not stipulate any prohibition or sanction to the decompilation and reverse engineering to date the program can be modified to the user's liking.

The difference here is that you don't need to pay for any license (optionally, to get rid of that "annoying window"). It's free maintained by the community as "Community Edition".


## Thanks to

Thank you for taking the trouble to read up to here, this is expected to be a better product than the original, with the difference that this will always be "Open Source".

Thanks to all the collaborators of the original app, without them this application would not have been what it is today.
